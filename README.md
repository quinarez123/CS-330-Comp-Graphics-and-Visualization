**How do I approach designing software?**

  When designing software I think about the concepts that I have learned in the course in order to incorporate it into the program. This gives me a chance to reinforce my understanding of it, ensuring that I can cement those learned skills into my bag of tricks. For the project I started off by including objects in my scene that gave me an opportunity to set complex, yet achievable goals. For example, I included a laptop object because it involved me using a single shape multiple times, the plane shape, yet it involves layering different planes and connecting them to simulate an object.

**How do I approach developing programs?**

  My strategy with developing this program begins with understanding the code that I am working with first. In order to change the code to fit my needs, I must first understand what it actually does. From the beginning of the document I went through line-by-line in order to dissect it's functions and syntax, while following the execution flow to beeter understand it. If there was something I didn't understand I simply refer to the internet or to the textbook for additional info. Through each milestone, I started evolving my knowledge of OpenGL allowing me to be more creative with my approach. 

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

  Throughout my educational career in computer science, I had realized how vast the field can be. Although alot of fields can use common programming languages, not everything can be transferrable and requires extensive expertise. Computational graphics and visualizations is no different as it is something I have never worked on before. This class has given me a foundational knowledge in working with rendering graphics in a 3D environment. I will build upon the skills learned in this class in order to work on projects that I personally find fun, especially when talking about video game development.
